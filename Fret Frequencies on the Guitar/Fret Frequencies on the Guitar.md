# Fret Frequencies on the Guitar

`algorithms`  `math` `numbers` 

Create a function that takes a number of a guitar string and the number of the fret and returns the corresponding frequency of the note.

- The formula to calculate the frequency is: String Frequency * 2^(fret/12).
- Round the frequency to the nearest hundreth.
- For this challenge, we use "Standard Tuning".

So, one fret = a semitone = a half step. From D to D♯ for instance.



### Examples

- fretFreq(5, 12) ➞ 220
- fretFreq(4, 6) ➞ 207.65
- fretFreq(2, 23) ➞ 932.32
